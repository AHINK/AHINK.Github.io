## Holy Shit, I did not realize what I'd committed to!

So about three weeks ago I decided as a marketer, what better way to build skills and brand my self, than building a brad website?

Easy, right?

I quickly hopped onto [Google Domains](domains.google.com) scooped up my name.com and tied it into my github account, figuring that Jekyll and Mark/Kram down wouldent be that hard. 

Well after following up on [this tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and having a meh site for a while I'd use Dean Attali's [Beautiful Jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) to speed everything up.

After the basics in the readme:
- Make a CNAME file if you're using a custom domain.
- update the config.yml
- Change the values in the 
- [Prose.io](prose.io) - this makes actually writing posts much easier. Who wants to edit in github's editor?
