title: A note on Geo Targeting for Ads
date: "2016-05-11"

## TLDR: skate where the puck's going to be. 

I'm working with a friend/client who's running a independent shop competing with several small chains locally, in a extremely fragmented B2C market. They're in the midwest, I'm here in currently sunny San Francisco. 

I'm looking for the competitors there, not here. And I make it blatantly clear via the search query including both the city and state. Yet in adwords I get consistently served ads for chain competitors from all over the valley, as they're set up for geo targeting on adwords. Their marketer is running adwords with a broad match, and geo targeting to in theory limit who is on the receiving end of their spend. Using a negative keyword list of state names and state abbreviations (provided that none of the state abbreviations match up with industry terms) where they are not in business could save the advertiser significant money, if they're serving ads for other locations consistently. 

Google on this:
