title: A note on Geo Targeting for Ads
---
## TLDR: skate where the puck's going to be. 

I'm working with a friend/client who's running a independent shop competing with several small chains locally, in a extremely fragemented B2C market. They're in the midwest, I'm here in currently sunny San Fransisco. 

I'm looking for the competitors there, not here. And I make it blaitently clear via the search querry including both the city and state. Yet in adwords I get consistenly served ads for chian competitors from all over the valley, as they're set up for geo targeting on adwords. Their marketer is running adwords with a broad match, and geo targeting to in theroy limit who is on the recieving end of their spend. Using a negitive keyword list of state names and state abbreaveations (provided that none of the state abbreaveations match up with industry terms) where they are not in business could save the advertiser significant money, if they're serving ads for other locations consistently. 

Google on this:
