## A New Year
Happy 2017!
In 2015 I started keeping a journal of sorts, 15-30 minutes of writing in a plain  [Moleskine](http://amzn.to/2j5m9Lj "Moleskine Black Plain") inorder to get the clutter of the prior day out of my mind. Things usually fell into 4 categories: 
-Things that are completely out of my control, e.g. someone returning my call 
-Things that are in my control and I should do because there's no downside and little effort is needed to do them, e.g. calling someone 
-Future hypotheticals that waste my time, e.g. what ifing 2nd and 3rd order effects of someone else doing something 
-Concrete problems that I need to address that day, e.g. things on maslow's hierarchy of needs

I also take a number of notes of what's worked for clients, the impacts of what I'm reading, and ideas for projects.
Going forward in 2017 I'll be sharing my thoughts about the books I'm reading, my take on growth process frameworks & documentation[(Patreon's Process)](https://patreonhq.com/why-would-i-ever-write-a-growth-experiment-doc-6ef2649fd215#.f6hsuxky9)[(Patreon's Experiment Doc)](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Experiment-Doc-Template-Patreon-Growth-Team-xbEoYTCXoXzB8ACw30Rxe)as well as the results of any experiments that I can share with you.
