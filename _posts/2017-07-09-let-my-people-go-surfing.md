## Yvon Chouinard & Patagonia

Amazon's recommendation engine has boiled down to two things for me: cooking tools and business textbooks. Eventually I'll get around to cooking the rest of the [4 Hour Chef](http://amzn.to/2t2Obf0) and post the videos to youtube. 

I'm a outdoors person. Patagonia is one of the few brands that's endured. Most others, including my perennial favorite [Mystery Ranch](www.mysteryranch.com) nee Dana Designs, have at some point sold out (to K2 in DD's case).

The outdoor recreation industry has had a number of ups and downs including a series of lawsuits that eventually forced Patagonia's hardware group, Chouinard Equipment, to be spun off into Black Diamond. Combine that with thin margins, changing consumer attitudes, globalization, and you get an interesting industry to study. 

A few months ago Amazon suggested the [The Patagonia Business Library](http://amzn.to/2uZ0WIP) to me and I bit, knowing that 90% of the value to me would most likely come from their book Patagonia's Tools for Grassroots Activists. 

let my people go surfing is less than an outright how to manual on responsible business, but a meandering walk through the history of Patagonia. That walk takes you through the anecdotes and decision points that lead to the majority of Patagonia’s policies, from day care and maternity/paternity leave to organic sourcing and manufacturing.

The interesting observation to me is that outside of companies that are either driven to these decisions by their consumers -e.x. Subway changing it’s bread to remove ‘safe’ plasticisers, or by access to talent - funded startups in SV, I Banking to some extent. Chouinard’s perspective is that these companies have been driven by financial considerations and desire to scale without thought as to the costs to their people and the environment in doing so. He and Patagonia have taken the opposite tack and focused on their people and the environment, recognizing that they are constraints to be optimized in the larger system that his business occupies. 

If you’re a fan of the brand it’s a worthwhile read for the backstory, or to emulate their management and environmental philosophies. let my people go surfing is not prescriptive, but outlines their product design, production, distribution, marketing, financial, human resources, management, and environmental philosophies in a way that allows the reader to understand the decisionmaking process and apply it themselves if they so choose.
