Hi, I'm a San Francisco based Growth Marketer with a background in Lean, SCRUM and process consulting. I've worked with companies from seed stage to series C and beyond. Focusing on persona generation and validation before running experiments has allowed me to help my clients validate their go to market plans and reach customers in new ways.

In SF and want to talk marketing? [Tweet at me](https://twitter.com/AllenHinkelman)
